IMAGE REPESENTATION GRAPHS

- To obtain the results with image examples (Fig.8 and Fig.9 of the paper), run "Test_main_image.m". 
Test images used in the experiments are included. Change the "size_block" parameter depending on the size of 
the test image.


NOTE: The algorithms use parfor commands (execute loop iterations in parallel) from the Parallel Computing Toolbox. 
"Parfor" loops can be changed to "for" loops, but the execution time will be higher.
